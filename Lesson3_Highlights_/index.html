            <p class="lead">Version Control often times called Revision Control allows you to record and track the files you edit over time. This easily allows you to go back and work on a previous version of a file for any reason. A Version Control System (VCS) is a great tool that many people use without knowing it. For example, I myself have been using this for years without knowing it. Currently I am the creative director for my Fraternity as well as the graphic and t shirt designer for many others and every design I make I will save multiple times with different names before finalizing it. This allows me to go back and make changes or use older versions just as a VCS allows programmers to.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As previously mentioned, Git is the most common Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). Git was designed as a free and open source DVCS that allows a user to work on anything from small projects to massive multiple person projects while still being at a low cost. Git stores the files in a different way than most other DVCS’s as it resembles snapshots of the files instead of the actual file itself. It allows the file versions to be accessible much more efficiently than other VCS’s. All changes to files are saved in Git which prevents loss or corruption of files which is a major issue with other types of VCS’s. In summary, Git is by far one of the most effective and efficient DVCS’s to use and I can’t wait to learn more in depth all the features it contains.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The next type of Version Control is a Centralized Version Control System. This form of Version Control was designed to allow multiple users access to specific files. Some examples of this system are Subversion and Perforce which contain one server holding all the past files while logging who accesses each file. This is one of the most common Version Control Systems as it allows everyone access to the past versions while still allowing the owner to see who and what is being viewed. However, some issues that can occur is that when this server is down, nobody can access the files stored on it. Similarly, to a LVCS, if the server is erased or lost then it is gone forever.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Going off my last topic, there are multiple forms of Version Control that allow past versions of files to be accessible. The first is Local Version Control Systems. This method is the most common yet can lead to the most problems as well. A Local Version Control System (LVCS) stores files on a local directory which gives the user total access to the saved files and versions if they need to go back and change something. The problem occurs when the user may forget which directory they are working in or saving files and then that leads to all the files being mixed up with one another.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Lastly, the way that we resolve the issues previously presented is with a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). This Version Control System not only allows each user to view the files stored on the server, but it completely copies the entire repository. This prevents any issues that may occur if the server is erased or lost because it allows any user to re-upload the repository as if it was always there. This is the most advanced form of Version Control and by far gives each user the most access to the files stored on the server. The most common DVCS is “Git” which you will soon learn about.</p>
